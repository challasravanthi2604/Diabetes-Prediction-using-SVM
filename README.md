# Diabetes Prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

This project predicts whether a person is diabetic or non-diabetic using machine learning.
Health attributes such as glucose level, BMI, and age are used for classification.

## Dataset
The dataset contains medical diagnostic measurements and a binary outcome:
- 1 → Diabetic
- 0 → Non-diabetic

## Model
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Linear kernel
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler

## Workflow
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Feature scaling
3. Train-test split
4. Model training
5. Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
